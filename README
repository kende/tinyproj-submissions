== TinyProj Submissions ==
** An unsolicited remix **

TinyProj is awesome. But somewhere in the current submission process something important is currently broken. The desires of clients aren't being communicated in an appealing way to a substantial portion of developers + designers. This unsolicited remix of the TinyProj submissions form is an attempt to fix that. 

Forking, code contributions, and feedback welcome!
